# FanDuel
This is a personal project I worked on in my senior year at high school. At the time, I was rejected from 16 colleges, and started to think about real life money-making opportunities. I am a huge sports fan and was really obsessed with daily fantasy sports. Therefore, I came up with this idea to write a lineup generator for FanDuel.</br>

It was toward the end of the basketball season, so I had limited time to test and actually apply my program. But the first time I put my seemingly working program into usage, I made $1400 in one night. The pictures are attached. Unfortunately, I had to leave the U.S. not long after that, so I stopped this project. After I started college at UT, I rediscovered my interests in school life, so I completely ceased this project.
